Define Bias and Variance.,"BiasWhen a model makes predictions, a disparity between the model's prediction values and actual values arises, and this difference is known as bias.

What is multicollinearity and how will you handle it in your regression model?,"If there is a correlation between the independent variables in a regression model, it is known as multicollinearity. Multicollinearity is an area of concern as independent variables should always be independent. When you fit the model and analyze the findings, a high degree of correlation between variables might present complications.There are various ways to check and handle the presence of multicollinearity in your regression model. One of them is to calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). If your model has a VIF of less than 4, there is no need to investigate the presence of multicollinearity. However, if your VIF is more than 4, an investigation is very much required, and if VIF is more than 10, there are serious concerns regarding multicollinearity, and you would need to correct your regression model.",

How does a Box-Cox transformation occur?,"This happens when there is a power transformation of non-normal dependent variables into normal variables. It involves a lambda parameter which, when set to zero, indicates that this transform is equivalent to log-transform.",
"What functions can be used to identify, drop, and replace missing or corrupted values?","Usually, missing or corrupted values happen when no data is available for certain variables; this can happen due to incomplete data entry, lost files, etc. Some functions that identify, drop, and replace missing or corrupted values are IsNull(), dropna( ), and Fillna() functions in Pandas.",
How is data divided in cross-validation?,"Cross validation divides data into three parts which are training, testing, and validation data. Data is further divided into k numbers of sub-parts, and the model is trained on k-1 of those sub-parts and then tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each of the k folds used exactly once for testing. The final performance metric is the average of the performance metrics from each of the k test sets.",
"A game exists where you are required to roll two six-faced dice. You stand a chance to win $50 if the sum of the two dice equals 7. However, you must pay $4 to play each time you roll both dice. Would you partake in this game?Note:  If you play 6 times, what is the probability of making money from this game?","The first condition states that if the sum of the values on the 2 dice is equal to 7, then you win $50. But for all the other cases, you must pay $4.To begin with, let's estimate the number of possible cases if we throw the two dice. The total number of cases is 6*6 = 36.In these 36 cases, how many produce a sum of 7?Possible combinations that produce a sum of 7 are (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2) and (6,1)..This indicates that out of 36 chances, 6 will produce a sum of 7. The ratio now is 6/36 = 1/6So this suggests that we have a chance of winning $50, once in every 6 games.So to answer the question, if I play 6 times, I will win $50 for one game, whereas for the other 5 games I will have to pay $4 each, which is $20 for all five games. Therefore, I will be at a winning advantage if I win $50 but end up paying $20. Statistically, I’ll be making a profit of $30 every 6 games.",
Assuming you have a two-column table of users and their friends coupled with a two-column table of users and their liked pages. Write a SQL query to make recommendations using pages that your friends have liked when it should not recommend pages that you have liked.,,images\question_106_image_1.jpg
When recommendations like “....people who did this also bought this” comes up on a website. What sort of algorithm propels that?,This is a recommendation based on collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering compares users' activities on a website and recommends similar actions to users with similar interests or behavior.,
What would you do if the model you have trained has a high variance and low bias?,"To solve high variance problems, we will use regularization techniques to rectify this or select the higher features in the feature importance graph to train the model.For low bias, we could use the bagging algorithm to divide the data into sub-parts using randomized sampling. Thereafter, we can create models with these samples using just one algorithm. Finally, we join the model prediction using voting classification or, perhaps, averaging.",
